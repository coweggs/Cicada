## What is Cicada?
Cicada is a simple program that brings keybinds to volume mixer, specifically on the currently active window. <br/>

## Main Features
- **Foreground Application Volume Control** <br>
  Using the specified hotkeys, you can change the volume of ONLY whatever app you're currently on! <br>
  Volume Up: `Alt+F7` <br>
  Volume Down: `Alt+F6` <br>
  Mute Self: `Alt+F5` <br>
- **Isolate Applcation Volume** <br>
  When isolate is pressed, every OTHER active audio session is muted. If all are already muted, then everything is unmuted. Active session always becomes unmuted. <br>
  Isolate: `Alt+M` <br>
- **Editable Volume Step** <br>
  Change the amount volume up and down change the session volume by! This can be changed via the settings window/config.ini.

You can access this settings menu via the tray icon. Alternatively, you can manually edit the `config.ini` file within the same directory as the exe.


## Notes
- Cicada can only modify the volume of apps with active audio sessions (the ones that show up in volume mixer).
- Some apps work on multiple processes, and thus Cicada may accidentally miss them with features such as isolate.
- Don't press F4 instead of F5 ðŸ¦„
